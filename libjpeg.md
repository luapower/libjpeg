## `local libjpeg = require'libjpeg'`

A ffi binding for the [libjpeg][libjpeg-home] 6.2 API.
Supports progressive loading, yielding from the reader function,
partial loading, fractional scaling and multiple pixel formats.
Comes with [libjpeg-turbo] binaries.

## API

------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------
`libjpeg.open(opt | read) -> img`    open a JPEG image for decoding
`img:load([opt]) -> bmp`             load the image into a bitmap
`img:free()`                         free the image
`libjpeg.save(opt)`                  compress a bitmap into a JPEG image
------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------

### `libjpeg.open(opt | read) -> img`

Open a JPEG image and read its header. `opt` is a table containing at least
the read function and possibly other options.

The read function has the form `read(buf, size) -> readsize`, it can yield
and it must signal I/O errors by raising an error. It must accept `nil`
for `buf` which means skip bytes (i.e. seek). It will only be asked to read
a positive number of bytes and it can return less bytes than asked,
including zero which signals EOF.

The `opt` table has the fields:

  * `read`: the read function (required).
  * `partial_loading`: `true/false` (default is `true`); display broken images
    partially or break with an error.
  * `warning`: a function to be called as `warning(msg, level)` on non-fatal
  errors.
  * `read_buffer`: optional, the read buffer to use.
  * `read_buffer_size`: the read buffer size.
  * `suspended_io`: use suspended I/O, i.e. yieldable callbacks
  (default is `true`). note that arithmetic decoding doesn't work with
  suspended I/O (browsers don't support arithmetic decoding either
  for the same reason).

The return value is an image object which gives information about the file
and can be used to load and decode the actual pixels. It has the fields:

  * `w`, `h`: width and height of the image.
  * `format`: the format in which the image is stored.
  * `progressive`: `true` if it's a progressive image.
  * `jfif`: JFIF marker (see code).
  * `adobe`: Adobe marker (see code).
  * `partial`: true if the image was found to be truncated and it was
  partially loaded (this may become `true` after loading the image).

__NOTE:__ Unknown JPEG formats are opened but the `format` field is missing.

### `img:load([opt]) -> bmp`

Load the image, returning a [bitmap] object. `opt` is an options table which
can have the fields:

  * `accept.<pixel_format>`: `true/false` specify one or more accepted
  pixel formats (see conversion table below).
  * `accept.bottom_up`: `true/false` (default is `false`) - specify that the
  output bitmap should have its rows upside-down.
  * `accept.stride_aligned`: `true/false` (default is `false`) - specify that
  the row stride should be a multiple of 4.
  * `scale_num`, `scale_denom`: scale down the image by the fraction
  scale_num/scale_denom. Currently, the only supported scaling ratios are M/8
  with all M from 1 to 16, or any reduced fraction thereof (such as 1/2, 3/4,
  etc.) Smaller scaling ratios permit significantly faster decoding since
  fewer pixels need be processed and a simpler IDCT method can be used.
  * `dct_method`: `'accurate'`, `'fast'`, `'float'` (default is `'accurate'`)
  * `fancy_upsampling`: `true/false` (default is `false`); use a fancier
  upsampling method.
  * `block_smoothing`: `true/false` (default is `false`); smooth out large
  pixels of early progression stages for progressive JPEGs.

#### Format Conversions

------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
__source formats__  __destination formats__

`ycc8`, `g8`        `rgb8`, `bgr8`, `rgba8`, `bgra8`, `argb8`, `abgr8`,
                    `rgbx8`, `bgrx8`, `xrgb8`, `xbgr8`, `g8`

`ycck8`             `cmyk8`
------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

__NOTE__: As can be seen, not all conversions are possible with libjpeg-turbo,
so always check the image's `format` field to get the actual format. Use
[bitmap] to further convert the image if necessary.

For more info on the decoding process and options read the
[libjpeg-turbo doc].

__NOTE:__ the number of bits per channel in the output bitmap is always 8.

### `img:free()`

Free the image and associated resources.

### `libjpeg.save(opt)`

Save a [bitmap] as JPEG. `opt` is a table containing at least the source
bitmap and an output write function, and possibly other options:

  * `bitmap`: a [bitmap] in an accepted format.
  * `write`: write data to a sink of the form `write(buf, size)`.
  * `finish`: optional function to be called after all the data is written.
  * `format`: output format (see list of supported formats above).
  * `quality`: `0..100` range. you know what that is.
  * `progressive`: `true/false` (default is `false`). make it progressive.
  * `dct_method`: `'accurate'`, `'fast'`, `'float'` (default is `'accurate'`).
  * `optimize_coding`: optimize huffmann tables.
  * `smoothing`: `0..100` range. smoothing factor.
  * `write_buffer_size`: internal buffer size (default is 4096).
  * `write_buffer`: internal buffer (default is to internally allocate one).
